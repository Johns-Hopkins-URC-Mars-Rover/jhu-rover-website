This general body meeting, the rover team had the privilege of welcoming [Dr. Kevin Lewis](https://hub.jhu.edu/experts/profiles/kevin-lewis/) to give a talk on the science being done by the [Curiosity Mars Rover](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/) and the planned [VIPER Lunar Rover](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viper/). Members were able to learn about how various high-level instruments work on the real rovers, along with how decisions are made about what the rovers are going to study.

Dr. Lewis's talk was very enlightening, which led several of the team members to ask various questions, ranging from broad questions about NASA and mission planning, down to the nitty-gritty details about how a specific part of a sensor works.

We are extremely grateful to Dr. Lewis for sharing his wealth of knowledge, and for taking the time on a weekend!
