A few weeks ago, the JHU Mars Rover Team had the exciting opportunity to connect with the community at two amazing events!

First, we were honored to participate in the revival of the Physics Fair, organized by the William H. Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy at Johns Hopkins. There, members of our team connected with professors, students, and families from around the Baltimore area. It was especially rewarding, as we aimed to explain many of the rover's components and systems using physics-related concepts—such as the centrifugal forces at play in our centrifuge, or how to select motors based on torque requirements. We're thrilled to see the Physics Fair return to campus and can’t wait for next year’s event!

Just a few days later, we presented at the Whiting School of Engineering Design Day, where we formally shared our progress on the rover. Several of our members spent the day interacting with faculty, fellow students, and industry professionals, explaining in depth the systems we’ve been developing over the past year. We are incredibly proud of our team for presenting such outstanding work and representing the next generation of engineers and scientists!
